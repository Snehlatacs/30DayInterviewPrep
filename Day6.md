### 📅 Day 6 – 30-Day Interview Crack Challenge

Welcome to Day 6 of my #30DayInterviewCrackChallenge & #100DaysOfCode journey!  
Today’s focus was on enhancing backend authentication, understanding hashing in DSA, revising aptitude, and behavioral prep.

---

#### 🔢 DSA – Hashing

**Topics Covered:**
- HashMap vs HashSet in Java
- Insertion, lookup, and deletion complexities
- Use cases: Frequency count, Duplicate detection, Pair sum problems

**Practice:**
- ✔️ Frequency of elements in array
- ✔️ Check if two arrays are equal
- ✔️ Count distinct elements

---

#### 🧑‍💻 MERN Stack – JWT Authentication

**Setup Completed:**
- `jsonwebtoken` and `bcrypt` installed
- JWT generation and verification logic
- Protected route with middleware
- Stored token securely on login

**API Endpoints Built:**
- `POST /register` – Register new user
- `POST /login` – Authenticate & get token
- `GET /dashboard` – Protected route (JWT required)

#### 📊 Aptitude – Profit & Loss (Part 2)

**Topics Studied:**
- Marked Price (MP)
- Discounts & Successive Discounts
- Profit % on SP & CP
- Loss scenarios and shortcut tricks

**Questions Practiced:**
- Effective Discount
- Successive profit calculation
- Marked Price vs Selling Price based problems

#### 📄 Practice Questions:
* An item costs ₹500. Marked price is ₹600. A 10% discount is given. What is the selling price?

* A shopkeeper gains 20% profit on cost price. Find the selling price if cost is ₹250.

* Successive profits of 10% and 20% on a ₹1000 item – what’s the total profit %?

* An item is marked at ₹800, sold for ₹640. What is the discount %?

* A shopkeeper gives 2 successive discounts of 10% and 15%. What’s the net discount?
